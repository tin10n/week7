✖️➗➕➖🟰 This is my submission for the Guided Inquiry Week 7 assignment, and it features a cute pocket calculator. 🟰➖➕➗✖️

** ** What’s in this project? ** **
This repository contains the core files to use the Pocket Calculator, and it’s hosted on Vercel where you can use it directly in your browser. 

Here's an overview of the files and what they do:

Files in this repository:
- README.md: You’re reading it! This file provides an introduction to the project and explains how everything works.

- index.html: Contains all the text content and the structure of the calculator. It's where the buttons are laid out and displayed.

- style.css: Includes the styles for the calculator. The page is fully responsive, so it looks great on any device.

- index.js: The heart of the calculator! This JavaScript file contains the core computing logic. It handles how each button is inputted. You’ll find comments throughout to explain how each part works.


You can also access the pocket calculator through the Vercel link.


*** *** Why I deserve a 4? *** ***
I believe I deserve a score of 4 because I’ve met all the requirements for the project, including both the core features and optional challenges.

Core Features:
- Players can select their option (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

- Once an option is selected, the computer also picks an option randomly. The results are displayed, showing whether the player won, lost, or tied.

Optional Challenges:
- Has percentage (%) conversion in the pocket calculator, and DEL button for erasing last digit entered.

- Contains History Log: Records the previous answers to the calculations, and allows the user to scroll down to view and recall them. History can also be cleared using the CE button and by keyboard.


** ** Key Takeaways: ** **

Throughout this project, I learned several important JavaScript and web development concepts that will help me in future projects.

Key Concepts I Learned:
- DOM Manipulation:
DOM Manipulation is used to retrieve elements by its id.

- Event Handling (.forEach &addEventListener):
Event handling is used to ensure that functionality works for keyboard and by clicking.

- Conditionals (if, else if, else):
Conditional statements are used to handle different inputs. When a user presses a button, the code checks whether the key is a number, operator, or special function, and how it should be computed.

- String Manipulation:
String Manipulation is used in several ways. Substring allows the removal of the last character from the output when DEL or backspace is used.

- Error Handling:
Error handling is used to catch errors during computing. For example, in javascript dividing by 0 results in 'Infinity,' but it is supposed to be Undefined. Therefore, in the calculator, it will display 'Error' instead.


** ** How to Use: ** **
- Click on one of the buttons to start computing or type it using the keyboard.
- Use the history log to review outputs.
- Clear history log by clicking the CE button or Escape on the keyboard.


** ** What’s Next? ** **
This project is a great learning experience, but I am looking forward to enhancing it further:
- Adding more advanced features like sin, cos, tan.
- Implementing history log within the calculator itself.
