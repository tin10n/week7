✖️➗➕➖🟰 This is my submission for the Guided Inquiry Week 7 assignment, and it features a cute pocket calculator. ✖️➗➕➖🟰

** ** What’s in this project? ** **
This repository contains the core files to usse the Pocket Calculator, and it’s hosted on Vercel where you can use it directly in your browser. 

Here's an overview of the files and what they do:

Files in this repository:
- README.md: You’re reading it! This file provides an introduction to the project and explains how everything works.

- index.html: Contains all the text content and the structure of the calculator. It's where the buttons are created.

- style.css: Includes the styles for the calculator. It also contains links to fonts and background images. The page is fully responsive, so it looks great on any device.

- index.js: The heart of the calculator! This JavaScript file contains the core computing logic. It handles how each button is inputed. You’ll find comments throughout to explain how each part works.


You can also access the pocket calculator through the Vercel link.


** ** Key Takeaways: ** **

Throughout this project, I learned several important JavaScript and web development concepts that will help me in future projects.

Key Concepts I Learned:
- DOM Manipulation:
DOM Manipulation is used to retrive elements by its id.

- Event Handling (.forEach &addEventListener):
Event haandling is used to ensure that functionality works for keyboard and by clicking.

- Conditionals (if, else, switch):
Conditional statements are used to determine the result.



** ** How to Use: ** **
- Click on one of the buttons to start computing or type it in on keyboard.


** ** What’s Next? ** **
This project is a great learning experience, but I am looking forward to enhancing it further:
- Adding more advanced features like sin, cos, tan.


** ‧₊˚ ⋅ Feel free to explore the code, use the calculator, and check out the live version hosted on Vercel! ‧₊˚ ⋅ **
